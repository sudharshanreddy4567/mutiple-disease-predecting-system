A Web App to Predict Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease Using Machine Learning

# 📋 Overview
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of three diseases:

# 🩸 Diabetes
# ❤️ Heart Disease
# 🧠 Parkinson's Disease
This user-friendly interface allows individuals to input their medical details and get instant predictions. Built with Streamlit and FastAPI, it offers real-time responses and helps with early disease diagnosis....

# 🚀 Features....
1. Diabetes Prediction 🩺
2. Heart Disease Prediction ❤️
3. Parkinson's Disease Prediction 🧠
4. Interactive User Interface 🎨
5. Real-time Prediction Results 🔮
6. FastAPI Backend for Efficient Model Deployment 🚀
